# ex-bank-transactions

An interactive **mobile-first banking transaction page** built with **Tailwind CSS** and **vanilla JavaScript**, designed as part of a forked repository project.

This page represents a simplified **banking UI** for viewing and managing transactions. It includes an interactive **drawer system** for transaction lists, a fixed **header and footer navigation**, and dynamic UI behavior optimized for **mobile viewports**.

---

##  Features

- **Responsive Design (Mobile-first)**  
  The layout is fully optimized for mobile screens with a `max-width` constraint and vertical scroll behavior.

- **Interactive Drawer**  
  The transaction list is placed inside a scrollable bottom drawer that expands or collapses smoothly based on user scroll interaction.

- **Header and Footer Navigation**  
  Persistent header and footer sections include interactive buttons for navigation, notifications, and user profile access.

- **Tailwind CSS Styling**  
  All styles are implemented using Tailwind utility classes for consistency, reusability, and performance.

- **RTL Language Support**  
  The layout uses Persian (`fa-IR`) right-to-left direction with localized text and currency display.

- **Vanilla JavaScript Interaction**  
  JavaScript (`main.js`) is used to handle UI interactions such as drawer behavior, scroll detection, and other event listeners.
